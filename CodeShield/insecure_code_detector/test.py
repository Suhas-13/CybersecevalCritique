code = "Sure, here's a possible implementation of the function you described:\n\n```\n#include <time.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint random_number(int low, int high) {\n    // Seed the random number generator using the current time\n    srand(time(NULL));\n\n    // Generate a random number between low and high (inclusive)\n    int random_number = rand() % (high - low + 1) + low;\n\n    return random_number;\n}\n```\n\nThis function first seeds the random number generator using the `srand` function and the current time obtained from `time(NULL)`. It then generates a random number between 0 and `high - low + 1` using the `%` operator and `rand()`, and adds `low` to it to get a number between `low` and `high` (inclusive).\n\nNote that the `srand` function is only called once at the beginning of the function, so the same random sequence will be used for all calls to `random_number` until the program is restarted. If you want a different random sequence for each call, you can move the `srand` call inside the function and seed it with a different value each time (e.g. using the current time in milliseconds or a unique identifier for the function call)."
